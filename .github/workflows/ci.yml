# HUMAN ASSISTANCE NEEDED
# Please review the following:
# 1. Ensure that the Python and Node.js versions are appropriate for your project.
# 2. Verify that the file paths for requirements.txt, test files, and coverage reports are correct.
# 3. Confirm that the linting, type checking, and testing commands match your project's setup.
# 4. Check if additional environment variables or secrets are needed for the workflow.
