## BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

Several factors could potentially impact the budget, and we have strategies in place to manage these risks:

1. Twitter API Changes:
   - Risk: Twitter may modify its API or pricing structure.
   - Mitigation: We've included a contingency fund and will closely monitor Twitter's developer announcements.

2. LLM API Usage:
   - Risk: Actual usage may exceed or fall below estimates.
   - Mitigation: We'll implement usage monitoring and adjust our estimates in real-time.

3. Cloud Infrastructure Costs:
   - Risk: Costs may increase with higher than expected data volumes.
   - Mitigation: We'll use auto-scaling and implement cost optimization strategies.

4. Scope Creep:
   - Risk: Additional features may be requested during development.
   - Mitigation: We'll use a change management process and adjust the budget if necessary.

5. Integration Challenges:
   - Risk: Unforeseen difficulties in integrating multiple technologies.
   - Mitigation: We've allocated additional time for integration and testing.

6. Currency Fluctuations:
   - Risk: For international services, exchange rates may impact costs.
   - Mitigation: We'll use forward contracts or build in a forex contingency.

7. Regulatory Changes:
   - Risk: New data protection laws may require system modifications.
   - Mitigation: We'll stay informed about upcoming regulations and have allocated funds for compliance.

To manage these considerations:

- We will conduct monthly budget reviews.
- Any potential overruns will be communicated promptly.
- We'll maintain a detailed risk register and update it regularly.
- We've included a 10% contingency fund in the total budget.

By proactively addressing these budget considerations, we aim to deliver the Code Skeptic Scanner within the estimated budget while maintaining flexibility to address unforeseen challenges.

```

To maintain the project timeline, special attention will be given to these critical path items:

- Early initiation of Twitter API integration to address any potential challenges
- Parallel development of the Notion integration and LLM response generation module where possible
- Regular integration tests throughout the development phase to identify and resolve issues early
- Allocation of additional resources to critical path tasks if delays are anticipated
- Weekly status meetings to monitor progress on critical path items and adjust timelines if necessary

By focusing on these critical path elements and maintaining flexibility in resource allocation, we aim to keep the project on track and deliver the Code Skeptic Scanner within the proposed timeline.
