    B --> C[Dashboard]
    B --> D[Tweet Management]
    B --> E[Analytics]
    B --> F[Configuration]
    G[Footer]
```

### Dashboard

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Real-time Tweet Feed] --> B[Tweet Cards]
    C[Key Metrics] --> D[Doubt Rating Chart]
    C --> E[Tweet Volume Chart]
    C --> F[Top AI Tools]
    G[Quick Actions] --> H[Generate Response]
    G --> I[Adjust Thresholds]
```

### Tweet Management

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Tweet List] --> B[Filters]
    A --> C[Sort Options]
    A --> D[Tweet Cards]
    D --> E[Tweet Details]
    E --> F[Response Generator]
    E --> G[User Info]
    E --> H[AI Tool Tags]
```

### Analytics

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[Date Range Selector] --> B[Overview Metrics]
    B --> C[Trend Charts]
    C --> D[AI Tool Comparison]
    C --> E[User Engagement]
    F[Custom Report Builder] --> G[Export Options]
```

### Configuration

    C[LLM Settings] --> D[Response Templates]
    E[Threshold Configuration] --> F[Popularity Thresholds]
    E --> G[Doubt Rating Thresholds]
    H[User Management] --> I[Role Assignment]
```

The user interface will be designed with accessibility in mind, following WCAG 2.1 AA standards. It will use a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the application, with a focus on readability and ease of use. The layout will be responsive, adapting to different screen sizes and devices, with a mobile-first approach.

Key UI Components:

1. Data Tables: For displaying tweet lists, user information, and analytics data
2. Charts: For visualizing trends and metrics using libraries like Chart.js or D3.js
3. Forms: For configuration settings and response generation
4. Modals: For displaying detailed information and confirmation dialogs
5. Tooltips: For providing additional context and guidance
6. Notifications: For alerting users to important events or actions

The UI will implement lazy loading and pagination where appropriate to ensure fast load times and smooth performance, even when dealing with large datasets. Real-time updates will be handled using WebSocket connections to provide users with the most up-to-date information without requiring manual refreshes.

5. Secure Backup and Recovery
   - Implement encrypted backups of all data stores
   - Regularly test data recovery procedures

6. Data Anonymization and Pseudonymization
   - Implement data anonymization techniques for analytics data
   - Use pseudonymization for user data where full anonymization is not possible

## SECURITY PROTOCOLS

The Code Skeptic Scanner will adhere to the following security protocols to maintain system integrity and protect against threats.

1. Secure Development Lifecycle (SDL)
   - Implement security requirements gathering
   - Conduct threat modeling during design phase
   - Perform regular code reviews and static analysis
   - Conduct penetration testing before major releases

2. Vulnerability Management
   - Implement a vulnerability scanning process using tools like Nessus or Qualys
   - Establish a responsible disclosure program for external security researchers
   - Implement a patch management process for timely vulnerability remediation

3. Incident Response Plan
   - Develop and maintain an incident response plan
   - Conduct regular tabletop exercises to test the plan
   - Implement automated alerting for security events

4. Security Monitoring and Logging
   - Utilize Google Cloud's Security Command Center for threat detection
   - Implement centralized logging using Google Cloud Logging
   - Set up real-time alerting for suspicious activities

5. Network Security
   - Implement network segmentation using Google Cloud VPC
   - Use Cloud Armor for DDoS protection and Web Application Firewall (WAF)
   - Implement intrusion detection and prevention systems (IDS/IPS)

6. Application Security
   - Implement input validation and output encoding to prevent injection attacks
   - Use Content Security Policy (CSP) headers to mitigate XSS attacks
   - Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse and brute force attacks

7. Third-Party Security
   - Conduct security assessments of third-party integrations
   - Implement vendor risk management process
   - Regularly review and update third-party permissions

8. Compliance and Auditing
   - Conduct regular security audits
   - Maintain compliance with relevant standards (e.g., GDPR, OWASP Top 10)
   - Implement automated compliance checks in CI/CD pipeline
