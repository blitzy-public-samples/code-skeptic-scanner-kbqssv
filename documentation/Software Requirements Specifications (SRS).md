```

This flowchart outlines the core processes of the Code Skeptic Scanner:

1. The system continuously monitors the Twitter Streaming API for new tweets.
2. Each tweet is evaluated for relevance to AI coding tools and skepticism.
3. If relevant, the tweet is checked against the popularity threshold.
4. Tweets meeting the criteria have their data extracted and stored in the Notion database.
5. A notification is issued in Notion for each new tweet added.
6. The LLM module generates an appropriate response to the tweet.
7. The generated response is stored in the Notion database.
8. Analytics are updated to reflect the new data.
9. If user action is required, the tweet and response are displayed in the UI.
10. Users can review and optionally respond to the tweet through the UI.
11. Any user actions are processed and the Notion database is updated accordingly.

The backend processes, implemented in Python, handle the core functionality of monitoring, data processing, and integration with external services. The frontend, built with React, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS, provides the user interface for interaction with the system and visualization of data.

This flowchart provides a high-level overview of the system's processes and can be used as a reference for development and understanding the system's workflow.

## COMMUNICATION INTERFACES

The Code Skeptic Scanner will utilize the following communication interfaces:

1. HTTPS
   - Purpose: Secure communication for all external API interactions and user interface access
   - Protocol: TLS 1.3
   - Port: 443

2. WebSocket
   - Purpose: Real-time updates for the user interface
   - Protocol: WSS (WebSocket Secure)
   - Port: 443

3. gRPC
   - Purpose: Internal communication between microservices
   - Protocol: HTTP/2
   - Data Format: Protocol Buffers

4. SMTP
   - Purpose: Sending email notifications
   - Protocol: SMTP over TLS
   - Port: 587

Data Formats:
- JSON: Used for most API communications and data storage
- Protocol Buffers: Used for efficient internal service communication
- CSV: Used for data exports in the analytics module
